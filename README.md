The joke app in Python
Hello everyone!

Today is the international Joke day! - 1st of April

No harm, no bad feelings, no negative vibes - just pure fun and smiles! 
IT Jokes to keep your day Fresh and Fun! 

Enjoy your day!

The app is written in Python.

How to Run the Updated Application:
-Replace the existing code in 1st-of-April-IT-Jokes.py with the updated script.
-Run the script by executing python 1st-of-April-IT-Jokes.py in your terminal or command prompt.

Updated Application Behavior:
-Each joke is now represented by a two-element tuple, where the first element is the setup and the second is the punchline.
-When displaying jokes, only the setup part is shown.
-After the user selects a joke, both the setup and the punchline are displayed.
-The user is then asked if they wish to continue, with a "Great!!!" message for a 'yes' response and a farewell message for 'no'.
